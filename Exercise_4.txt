It is not difficult to test a class thouroughly.
It is easier to keep track of the tests, compared til a main().
This is because a main-test doesn't follow a "standard".

Extensibility: It is easiest to extend via unit-testing
because you catch the errors early on. The code-area you
have to search is smaller.

Maintainability: Unit testing is more maintainable since
you are using a framework which is designed to assist you
when you are writing testing-code.

Readability: It is easier to read Unit-testing, but this
require the new persons to be familiar with the framework.

Automation: Unit testing.
